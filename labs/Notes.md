pwd means print working directory
ls means list and will show everything that is in your directory
clear clears the terminal
control C will cancel whatever you were currently typing for if you get stuck
cd and then wherever you want to go helps you travel in the directory
to specify options for ls, you do ls - and then after the dash put a letter (-F would show files)
man means manual and it means the next command after that will show the operators manual for that command
ls -lrth shows a bunch of information about the directories
use tab to autofill commands
use head and then the directory to see the beginnning of it
cat prints the whole file to the screen
to get out of the directory, us cd ../
cd ../ is stackable, you can keep doing it to get to the home directory
a shortcut to get back to the home directory is cd ~
